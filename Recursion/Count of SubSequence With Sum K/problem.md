# Problem Statement
Given an array nums and an integer k.Return the number of non-empty subsequences of nums such that the sum of all elements in the subsequence is equal to k.

     Input : nums = [4, 9, 2, 5, 1] , k = 10 , Output : 2
    Explanation : The possible subsets with sum k are [9, 1] , [4, 5, 1].
